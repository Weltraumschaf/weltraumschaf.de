## Unit Test Your Cocoa Application with GHUnit

In the last years  I have good experiences with [Unit  testing][1]. It gives you
more  safety  that  your  software  meets your  behavioral  requirements.  So  I
searched for  some frameworks to  make tests for  my Cocoa application.  I found
[GHUnit][2].  A  preoject  started  by  [Gabriel  Handford][3].  The  source  is
available on [GitHub][4].
