## Launched Website for a Video Cutter

Some days  ago I launched  a new [website][1]. It’s  the portfolio of  my former
neighbor.  He’s  a talented  digital  video  cutter  always searching  for  new
interesting projects  to work on near  Stuttgart in Germany. For  this website I
used  first  time  the  [Sublime][2]  video player.  Very  nice  tool.  Easy  to
integrate and  with powerful  JavaScript API. The  player supports  HTML5 video
tag but also provides  a Flash fallback for browser which  did not support HTML5
or a proper codec.
