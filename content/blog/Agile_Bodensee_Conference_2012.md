## Agile Bodensee Conference 2012

My [brother][1] has  organized his first conference. It is  also the first local
agile conference at  [Bodensee in Germany][2]. It is the  [Agile Bodensee][3] on
28th of September.

One  of my  favorite highlight  is the  fact that  the conference  fee is  really
cheap. The  fee for  the whole  day is only  50 Bugs.  Other highlights  are the
keynote speakers: [Jurgen Appelo][4] and [Joseph Pelrine][5].
